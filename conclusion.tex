OrchardScope is a low-cost network and computing architecture for precision agriculture applications. It supports high temporal and spatial resolution for the data collection from the farm, which enables farmers applications as well gathers fine-grained data for agricultural scientists. OrchardScope nodes are powered by the solar power and use novel probabilistic energy forecasting techniques to modulate their operation. It has a computing architecture that utilizes collaborative edge computing to enable real-time applications. It also designs a device+camera placement strategy that allows us to capture the high quality images of the various parts of the trees at high temporal granularity. 
As a part of this project, we have presented the proposal on how should the OrchardScope system would look like, we plan to develop this platform and work with agricultural researchers to deploy these in the greenhouse and actual farms. We also plan to work on developing novel computer vision applications that will be enabled by this large dataset.
