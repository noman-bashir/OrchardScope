\myname{} is a low-cost network and computing architecture for precision agriculture applications. It supports high temporal and spatial resolution data capture, which enables efficient farm management, as well as provides fine-grained environmental and plant data for agricultural scientists. \myname{} nodes are powered by solar harvesting and use novel probabilistic energy forecasting techniques to manage their operation. Furthermore, it has a computing architecture that utilizes collaborative edge computing to enable real-time applications.  We have developed a prototype mid-tier device to be deployed at an apple orchard managed by the school of agriculture at a public university in the northeast USA and expect to deploy a prototype that implements our proposed architecture by Spring/Summer 2020 where we will evaluate novel embedded computer vision applications, collect fine-grained climate data, and study the unique wireless environment of agricultural settings and their impact on the bottom tier.

% The device consists of a Jetson Nano, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module, a high resolution IP-based Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera, and a solar panel + battery power source. We implement various mid-tier and back-end services, i.e. camera control to capture desired objects, solar energy forecasting. These devices are expected to be deployed in the farm in Spring/Summer 2020.
