To the best of our knowledge, there is no single IoT platform designed for precision agriculture applications that is \emph{simple}, \emph{extensible}, and \emph{open-source}. There has been various academic and commercial efforts that target specific precision agriculture applications, which are discussed next. 

Microsoft Research's FarmBeats~\cite{vasisht2017farmbeats} is an end-to-end IoT platform for data-driven agriculture with precision agriculture being one of its applications. The key problem with FarmBeats is the lack of flexibility in the architecture, i.e. requiring the presence of a farmer's home at the farm with a computer and internet connectivity. These assumptions may not be true for many farms, especially in the developing countries. Also, FarmBeats is primarily a data acquisition system and does not possess the capability to perform real-time inferences and control over actuators inside the farm, i.e. processing visual data in real-time to release the insecticide spray. 


In addition, there has been various commercial efforts that focus on one or a few applications at best. For example, See \& Spray technology by Blue River focuses only on smart herbicide spraying~\cite{see&spray}, CropX platform is designed for smart irrigation and fertilizing~\cite{cropx}, and FieldAgent and PrecisionHawk systems focus on generating field maps to monitor crop growth and health~\cite{precisionhawk, fieldagent-sentera}. The heterogeneity of devices and proprietary technology used by different vendors will give rise to similar problems of interoperability and complexity faced by the Smart Home and IoT community today~\cite{home-os-challenges}.
